&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let Me Do It For You&lt;/strong&gt; is a weird platformer about a dog who can extend his nose and, not only the nose can stretch GREAT GREAT GREAT distance, it can also change directions lmao.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the title one can tell that this game is inspired from the Borzoi Dog meme. Personally I have nothing much to say about this theme, it is cute and really, really funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;growth&#34;&gt;Growth
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the former experiences in mind, I am able to finished my tasks quicker and smoother this time. I also managed to study new components of Unity when facing unfamiliar problems. When creating the nose stretching effects, I researched and find a Unity component called Line Renderer that can draw textured lines. Using scripts to control this component, the body of the nose is drawn as the nose head moves, creating the effect of nose stretching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always make backup files before making CRAZY changes to the codes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some mechanics are just complex and unnecessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Borzoi Dogs are funny&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fish-Dang Bot: Rolling Laud&lt;/strong&gt; is a platformer about a fish who dreams to be a dung beetle. The interesting part of this game is that players can enlarge the dung into a stepping stone via rolling them in the dung pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;grab-that-dung&#34;&gt;Grab that Dung!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first coding task I was given is to write a code for the fish to grab the dung objects. Frankly speaking, I had never approached a problem like this, not even close. I was about to ask my leader to give me an easier task, but somehow I accept it, probably because I don&amp;rsquo;t want them to look down on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this decision had made the next few hours a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right, it should be easy to do the grab. All I have to do is to check whether the player pressed the grab button when the dung is in player&amp;rsquo;s box trigger. As the conditions were fulfilled, I just need to attach the dung to the player. The only problem here is: how to I attach the dung to the player? After several failed trials, I was almost insane, but was still anxious to tell this to my teammates. Luckily, the leader perceived my trouble and actively offers her help. With her suggestions, I finally came up with a idea: if I simply set the dung as the children of the player, the dung will naturally moves with the player. And thus my first task is successfully done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some reflections: what makes a team a team is that members always supports each other, resulting in a &amp;ldquo;1+1 &amp;gt; 2&amp;rdquo; effect. There is no need to be timid nor worried when helped by others. Instead, it can increase the efficiency and improve our own skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;1.png&#34; width=50%&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;debugging&#34;&gt;Debugging
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the final stage of the development, a serious bug was discovered. Because everyone is busy, our leader decides to neglect the bug. However, I know that this game will become partially unplayable if the bug isn&amp;rsquo;t resolved. Therefore, I quickly finished my part and offers to debug. The bug is about jumping malfunctions on the dung platform. After an examination of the source scripts, I hypothesized that the problem is due to the ray detectors shoot out from the player. When the player stands on the dung, the rays failed to reach the dung, thereby disabling jumping(if rays detects the dung, it will change player status to grounded, so jumping would be allowed) The bug was them solved by simply adding new ray that shoots further. Personally, I think this is my greatest contribution to the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a fish can become a dung beetle, then there should be no way I can&amp;rsquo;t be a game designer XD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sharing progress is required, use professional platforms such as GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always make sure the members are using the same Unity versions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do not touch the project files of others!!!!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
